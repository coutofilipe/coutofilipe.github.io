                <p>Improve policies aiming at supporting knowledge transfer and strengthening opportunities for open
                    innovation between the triple helix partners in the field of preventative health and thermalism in
                    order to accelerate the launch on the market of innovative solutions for developing a healthy

                <h3>Partnership:</h3>

                <p>Eight partners (one Association, three Universities, three Regional Development Agencies, one
                    Innovation centre) from eight countries (France, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Lithuania,
                    Portugal, and Slovenia). When relevant, authorities in charge of targeted policies are committed to
                    provide their support (e.g. Portugal – CCDR-N). Relevant stakeholders within each region will be
                    strongly involved in the exchange of experience at interregional level and planned adaptation of
                    policy instruments (ten stakeholders accepted collaboration with FMUP – Portugal).</p>

                    each one as regards thermalism. Subsequent introduction into the regional policies of innovative
                    health solutions for thermal spa regions (the final purpose of Phase 2 – two years). One policy
                    instrument is addressed per region, related to structural funds programmes.</p>

                <h3>Policy instrument tackled within the project (FMUP):</h3>

                <p>Norte 2020 is composed of an integrated set of priorities and funding instruments addressing the main
                    challenges and opportunities of Portugal’s Norte region. As regards the Life and Health Sciences
                    priority, the goal is to strengthen the articulation between, on the one hand, regional research on
                    tissue engineering, cancer, neuroscience and surgical techniques and, on the other hand, industries
                    and services in the health sector (e.g. pharmaceuticals, medical devices, health services, health
                    and wellness tourism, and cosmetics). Improved policies and facilitation of triple-helix cooperation
                    will promote the creation and development of innovative startups, health prevention, new products
                    and services. Encouraging smart investments in health care and thermalism will also facilitate the
                    improvement in the health industry.</p>
